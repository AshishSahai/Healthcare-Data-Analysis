# üè• Healthcare Data Analysis with SQL Integration

This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a healthcare dataset. It cleans, analyzes, and visualizes healthcare data with integration of SQL for querying and analysis.

## üìÅ Dataset

Place your `healthcare_dataset.csv` file in the project directory. Optionally, a SQLite database file (`healthcare.db`) can be used for structured queries.

### Expected CSV Fields
- Name, Gender, Age, Blood Type
- Medical Condition, Admission Date, Discharge Date
- Hospital, Doctor, Insurance Provider
- Billing Amount, Admission Type, Medication

## üí° Key Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- SQL-based Analysis with Pandas & SQLite
- Missing & Duplicate Data Detection
- Visualization of:
  - Insurance Providers by Medical Condition
  - Billing by Age Group
  - Stay Duration vs Billing Amount
- Summary Insights

## üóÉ SQL Integration

You can load the dataset into a SQLite database using the following:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("healthcare_dataset.csv")
conn = sqlite3.connect("healthcare.db")
df.to_sql("patients", conn, if_exists="replace", index=False)

# Example SQL query
query = "SELECT Medical_Condition, COUNT(*) FROM patients GROUP BY Medical_Condition"
pd.read_sql_query(query, conn)
```

üìä Visualizations

    üìà Bar chart: Total billing by age group

    üìâ Line chart: Average billing by age group

    üü° Scatter plot: Stay duration vs. billing amount

    üè• Grouped bar chart: Insurance providers by medical condition

üõ† Requirements

    Python 3.7+

    pandas

    matplotlib

    seaborn

    numpy

    sqlite3 (included with Python)

Install dependencies

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

üöÄ Usage

Run the script:

python your_script_name.py

Make sure:

    healthcare_dataset.csv is in the same directory

    healthcare.db will be created if using SQL integration

üìÅ Outputs

    duplicate_rows.csv: Saved duplicate records

    healthcare.db: SQLite database (optional)

üîí Data Privacy

‚ö†Ô∏è If using real-world healthcare data, ensure compliance with HIPAA, GDPR, or other relevant data protection laws.
